# dev-tools-linux
This is an Electron app that allows you to install and setup your Ubuntu development machine.

### Requirements
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)
- [Electron packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager)

### Commands
```bash
# Start the angular app in the browser
$ npm run start
# Start the electron app
$ npm run electron:start
# We need to build the app before packaging it
$ npm run electron:build
# Package the app for Linux
$ npm run package:linux
```
For more commands take a look into the [package.json](package.json) file.

### Development
The app is splint in two directories:
- **electron** - the electron app files
- **src** -  the angular app files

This app is built using Angular and Electron.
Usually electron apps have two processes. The main process and the renderer process.
The files in the **electron** folder run in the main process and
the **angular** app runs in the renderer process.

As far as I found, it's a consensus on the fact that you should do as less work 
as possible on the main process. Also we should keep the renderer process as lite
as we can and use some sort of multi-threading and such. 

To start the app for development you will need to open two terminals.
```bash
# In the first terminal run the angular app in watch mode
$ npm run angular:watch
# Make sure you finished running the first one before the second.
# Just to be safe.
# In the second terminal run the electron app in watch mode
$ npm run electron:watch
```

We use [electron-remote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-remote) for running tasks outside the main electron thread.
